SVent 1.10 - Nordic UART Services Central (NUS C) Test
- Attach all peripherals as outlined in the Schematic to a chip running the '8_NUS' test suite
- No further peripherals required for this chip


Expected Result:
- Central Scanning should connect with 'SmartLabs Test'
- Every 2 seconds, the LED connected to the '8_NUS' chip should turn on and off
- The RTT debug window should show retrieved info 'on was recevied', and 'off was received'
